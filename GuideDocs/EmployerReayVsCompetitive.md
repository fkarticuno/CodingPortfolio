Employer Ready vs.
Employer Competitive

There is a difference between being Employer Ready and Employer Competitive. Employer Ready means that
you have the minimum of what is expected to enter into a typical job application process. Your job search
materials are strong and complete, and with some luck, an employer will notice you in a tall stack of applications
and decide you are the right fit for the role. Employer Competitive means that you have given yourself the best
chance to secure your desired job. Your job search materials are excellent; you are well-prepared for interviews;
and, you are pro-actively seeking and pursuing the jobs that you want with multiple networking strategies.
